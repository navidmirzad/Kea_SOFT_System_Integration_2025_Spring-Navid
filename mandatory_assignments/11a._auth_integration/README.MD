# Documentation on my step by step setup for integrating with a SSO-Service (Single-Sign-On) 

# I lately have been working with Node.js, Express and PHP Laravel a lot and was looking for something that worked well with that,
# so I did some research and found Auth0 and seeing that it supports them both and more:
- .NET
- Express
- Java
- Laravel
- PHP 
- Spring Boot

# Pros 
- Compatible with a lot of different languages and frameworks
- Easy to integrate, can be setup with a few lines of code and installing 2-3 npm packages.
- Nice UI

# Cons
- Only have 22 days free trial with the premium plan. 
- Ran into some issues when trying to install the npm package for Auth0-Nodejs-Express
